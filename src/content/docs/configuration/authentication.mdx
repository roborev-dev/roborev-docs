## Claude Code

**Claude Code** uses your Claude subscription by default. roborev deliberately ignores `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment to avoid unexpected API charges.

To use Anthropic API credits instead of your subscription:

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
anthropic_api_key = "sk-ant-..."
```

## Codex

**Codex** uses the authentication configured in your Codex installation.

Run `codex auth` to set up authentication if needed.

## Gemini

**Gemini** uses the authentication configured in your Gemini CLI installation.

## Copilot

**Copilot** uses your GitHub Copilot subscription via the GitHub CLI authentication.

## OpenCode

**OpenCode** uses API keys configured in its own settings.

## Environment Variable Expansion

Sensitive values can reference environment variables:

```toml
# ~/.roborev/config.toml
anthropic_api_key = "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
```

Set the value in your shell:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

This keeps secrets out of config files while still allowing roborev to use them.
