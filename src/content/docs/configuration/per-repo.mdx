title: Per-Repository Configuration
description: Configure roborev behavior for individual repositories
---

Create `.roborev.toml` in your repository root to customize roborev behavior for that project.

## Example Configuration

```toml
agent = "claude-code"      # AI agent to use
review_context_count = 5   # Recent reviews to include as context
display_name = "backend"   # Custom name shown in TUI (optional)
excluded_branches = ["wip", "scratch"]  # Branches to skip reviews on

# Reasoning levels: thorough, standard, fast
review_reasoning = "thorough"  # For code reviews (default: thorough)
refine_reasoning = "standard"  # For refine command (default: standard)

# Project-specific review guidelines
review_guidelines = """
No database migrations needed - no production databases yet.
Prefer composition over inheritance.
All public APIs must have documentation comments.
"""
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `agent` | string | AI agent to use for this repo |
| `display_name` | string | Custom name shown in TUI |
| `review_context_count` | int | Number of recent reviews to include as context |
| `excluded_branches` | array | Branches to skip automatic reviews on |
| `review_reasoning` | string | Reasoning level for reviews: thorough, standard, fast |
| `refine_reasoning` | string | Reasoning level for refine: thorough, standard, fast |
| `review_guidelines` | string | Project-specific guidelines for the reviewer |

## Review Guidelines

Use `review_guidelines` to give the AI reviewer project-specific context:

- Suppress irrelevant warnings ("no migrations needed yet")
- Enforce conventions ("use tabs not spaces")
- Add domain criteria ("check for PII exposure")

```toml
review_guidelines = """
This is a CLI tool - no web security concerns.
Performance is critical - flag any O(n^2) or worse algorithms.
All error messages must be user-friendly.
"""
```

## Excluded Branches

Skip automatic reviews on work-in-progress branches:

```toml
excluded_branches = ["wip", "scratch", "experiment"]
```

Reviews triggered manually with `roborev review` still work on these branches.
