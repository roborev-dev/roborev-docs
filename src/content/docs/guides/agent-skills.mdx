Install slash commands that let AI agents fix review findings directly:

```bash
roborev skills install
```

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/roborev:address <job_id>` | Fetch a review and fix its findings |
| `/roborev:respond <job_id> [message]` | Add a response to document changes |

## Usage

When you receive a review notification like "Review #1019: Fail", ask your agent:

```
/roborev:address 1019
```

The agent:
1. Fetches the review
2. Reads relevant files
3. Fixes issues by priority (high severity first)
4. Runs tests
5. Offers to commit

## Agent-Specific Syntax

| Agent | Syntax |
|-------|--------|
| Claude Code | `/roborev:address`, `/roborev:respond` |
| Codex | `$roborev:address`, `$roborev:respond` |

## Updating Skills

Skills are updated automatically when you run:

```bash
roborev update
```

## How It Works

Skills are installed as agent-specific configuration:

- **Claude Code**: Custom slash commands in `~/.claude/`
- **Codex**: Custom agent skills directory

The skill scripts call `roborev show --job <id> --json` to fetch review data, then parse and present findings to the agent in a structured format.

## Interactive vs Automated

Skills provide an **interactive** workflow - you ask your agent to address specific findings and review the changes before committing.

For **automated** fixing, use `roborev refine` which runs in a loop until all reviews pass.
