Install slash commands that let AI agents fix review findings directly:

```bash
roborev skills install
```

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/roborev:fix [job_id...]` | Discover and fix all unaddressed review findings in one pass |
| `/roborev:address <job_id>` | Fetch a single review and fix its findings |
| `/roborev:respond <job_id> [message]` | Add a response to document changes |

## Usage

### Fix all unaddressed reviews at once

The most powerful skill is `/roborev:fix`. With no arguments it discovers all unaddressed failed reviews on recent commits and fixes them in a single pass:

```
/roborev:fix
```

You can also target specific jobs:

```
/roborev:fix 1019 1021
```

The agent:
1. Discovers unaddressed reviews (or uses provided job IDs)
2. Fetches all reviews and collects findings
3. Groups findings by file and prioritizes by severity
4. Fixes all issues across all reviews
5. Runs tests to verify
6. Records a comment on each addressed review
7. Offers to commit

This is the interactive equivalent of `roborev fix --batch` -- the agent sees all findings at once and can make coordinated fixes across related issues.

### Fix a single review

When you want to address one specific review:

```
/roborev:address 1019
```

The agent fetches the review, fixes issues by priority, runs tests, and offers to commit.

## Agent-Specific Syntax

| Agent | Syntax |
|-------|--------|
| Claude Code | `/roborev:fix`, `/roborev:address`, `/roborev:respond` |
| Codex | `$roborev:fix`, `$roborev:address`, `$roborev:respond` |

## Checking Skill Status

See which skills are installed and whether any need updating:

```bash
roborev skills
```

## Updating Skills

Skills are updated automatically when you run:

```bash
roborev update
```

## How It Works

Skills are installed as agent-specific configuration:

- **Claude Code**: Custom slash commands in `~/.claude/`
- **Codex**: Custom agent skills directory

The skill scripts call `roborev show --job <id> --json` to fetch review data, then parse and present findings to the agent in a structured format.

## Interactive vs Automated

Skills provide an **interactive** workflow -- your agent addresses findings and you review the changes before committing. `/roborev:fix` is the fastest interactive option since it batches all outstanding findings into one pass.

For **fully automated** fixing, use `roborev fix --batch` (headless, no agent interaction) or `roborev refine` (iterative loop until all reviews pass).
