Install slash commands that let AI agents request reviews and fix findings directly:

```bash
roborev skills install
```

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/roborev:review [commit] [--type ...]` | Request a code review for a commit |
| `/roborev:review-branch [--base ...] [--type ...]` | Review all commits on the current branch |
| `/roborev:design-review [commit]` | Request a design review for a commit |
| `/roborev:design-review-branch [--base ...]` | Design review all commits on the current branch |
| `/roborev:fix [job_id...]` | Discover and fix all unaddressed review findings in one pass |
| `/roborev:address <job_id>` | Fetch a single review and fix its findings |
| `/roborev:respond <job_id> [message]` | Add a response to document changes |

## Usage

### Review a commit

Request a code review without leaving your agent session:

```
/roborev:review
/roborev:review abc123
/roborev:review --type security
```

The review runs in the background via `roborev review --wait`, so you can keep working. When it completes, the agent presents the findings and offers to address them with `/roborev:address`.

### Review a branch

Review all commits since the current branch diverged from main:

```
/roborev:review-branch
/roborev:review-branch --base develop
/roborev:review-branch --type security
```

This runs `roborev review --branch --wait` in the background. Same workflow: results are presented when ready, with an offer to address findings.

### Design review

Request a design-focused review that evaluates completeness, feasibility, and task scoping:

```
/roborev:design-review
/roborev:design-review abc123
```

This is a shorthand for `roborev review --wait --type design`. It runs in the background and follows the same pattern as the other review skills.

### Design review a branch

Review all commits on the current branch with a design-focused lens:

```
/roborev:design-review-branch
/roborev:design-review-branch --base develop
```

This is the branch equivalent of `/roborev:design-review`, running `roborev review --branch --wait --type design` in the background.

### Fix all unaddressed reviews at once

The most powerful skill is `/roborev:fix`. With no arguments it discovers all unaddressed failed reviews on recent commits and fixes them in a single pass:

```
/roborev:fix
```

You can also target specific jobs:

```
/roborev:fix 1019 1021
```

The agent:
1. Discovers unaddressed reviews (or uses provided job IDs)
2. Fetches all reviews and collects findings
3. Groups findings by file and prioritizes by severity
4. Fixes all issues across all reviews
5. Runs tests to verify
6. Records a comment on each addressed review
7. Offers to commit

This is the interactive equivalent of `roborev fix --batch` -- the agent sees all findings at once and can make coordinated fixes across related issues.

### Fix a single review

When you want to address one specific review:

```
/roborev:address 1019
```

The agent fetches the review, fixes issues by priority, runs tests, and offers to commit.

## Agent-Specific Syntax

| Agent | Syntax |
|-------|--------|
| Claude Code | `/roborev:review`, `/roborev:review-branch`, `/roborev:design-review`, `/roborev:design-review-branch`, `/roborev:fix`, `/roborev:address`, `/roborev:respond` |
| Codex | `$roborev:review`, `$roborev:review-branch`, `$roborev:design-review`, `$roborev:design-review-branch`, `$roborev:fix`, `$roborev:address`, `$roborev:respond` |

## Checking Skill Status

See which skills are installed and whether any need updating:

```bash
roborev skills
```

## Updating Skills

Skills are updated automatically when you run:

```bash
roborev update
```

## How It Works

Skills are installed as agent-specific configuration:

- **Claude Code**: Custom slash commands in `~/.claude/`
- **Codex**: Custom agent skills directory

The review skills call `roborev review --wait` to enqueue reviews and wait for results. The fix skills call `roborev show --job <id> --json` to fetch review data, then parse and present findings to the agent in a structured format.

## Interactive vs Automated

Skills provide an **interactive** workflow. The review skills (`/roborev:review`, `/roborev:review-branch`, `/roborev:design-review`, `/roborev:design-review-branch`) let you request reviews from within your agent session and see results inline. The fix skills (`/roborev:fix`, `/roborev:address`) let your agent address findings while you review the changes before committing.

For **fully automated** fixing, use `roborev fix --batch` (headless, no agent interaction) or `roborev refine` (iterative loop until all reviews pass).
