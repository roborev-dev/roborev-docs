title: Code Analysis and Assisted Refactoring
description: Run built-in code analysis and automatically apply fixes with roborev analyze and roborev fix
---

Use `roborev analyze` to run structured code analysis on your files, and `roborev fix` to automatically apply the suggested changes. Together they provide a repeatable workflow for codebase-wide refactoring driven by AI agents.

```bash
roborev analyze refactor 'src/handlers/*.go'                    # Analyze files for refactoring opportunities
roborev analyze complexity --fix internal/storage/            # Analyze and automatically fix
roborev analyze duplication --per-file --fix 'internal/*.go'    # Analyze and fix one file at a time
roborev fix                                                    # Address all unaddressed findings
```

## Analysis Types

Seven built-in analysis types target common refactoring concerns:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `test-fixtures` | Find test fixture and helper opportunities to reduce duplication |
| `duplication` | Find code duplication across files |
| `refactor` | Suggest refactoring opportunities |
| `complexity` | Analyze complexity and suggest simplifications |
| `api-design` | Review API consistency and design patterns |
| `dead-code` | Find unused exports and unreachable code |
| `architecture` | Review architectural patterns and structure |

List available types with `roborev analyze --list`, or preview a prompt template with `roborev analyze --show-prompt <type>`.

## Basic Usage

Point `analyze` at an analysis type and one or more file paths, directories, or glob patterns:

```bash
# Analyze test files for fixture opportunities
roborev analyze test-fixtures 'internal/storage/*_test.go'

# Find duplication across a package
roborev analyze duplication cmd/roborev/

# Review API design patterns
roborev analyze api-design 'pkg/api/*.go'

# Architecture review of a directory
roborev analyze architecture internal/storage/
```

Results appear in the TUI as jobs labeled with their analysis type (e.g. `test-fixtures`, `duplication`). Use `roborev show <job_id>` or the TUI to read findings. You can then use the job IDs to address findings at your discretion with `roborev fix <job_id>`.

## Branch Mode

Use `--branch` to automatically analyze files changed on the current branch since diverging from the base:

```bash
roborev analyze refactor --branch                  # Analyze current branch
roborev analyze complexity --branch --per-file     # Per-file analysis of branch changes
roborev analyze refactor --branch --base develop   # Compare against develop
```

To analyze a different branch without switching to it, specify the branch name with `=`:

```bash
roborev analyze refactor --branch=feature-xyz
roborev analyze duplication --branch=feature-xyz --per-file
```

Note: use `--branch=name` (with `=`), not `--branch name`. The space-separated form treats `name` as a positional file argument.

Branch mode automatically discovers changed files and filters out non-code files (`.md`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.toml`, `.html`, `.css`, `.scss`). File contents are read from the git tree, not the working directory, so uncommitted edits are not included.

## Per-File Mode

By default, all files are bundled into a single analysis job. Use `--per-file` to create a separate job for each file:

```bash
roborev analyze complexity --per-file 'internal/storage/*.go'
roborev analyze refactor --per-file --wait '*.go'
```

Per-file mode is useful when:

- Total file content would be too large for a single prompt
- You want analysis jobs to run in parallel across the worker queue
- You plan to fix files one at a time

## Using Fix with Reviews

`roborev fix` runs **synchronously in the foreground**: it blocks until the agent finishes, applies changes directly to your working tree, and commits the result. It does not run in the background or queue work for the daemon.

`roborev fix` works with any review, not just analysis results. Use it to address commit reviews too:

```bash
roborev fix                        # Fix all unaddressed reviews on this branch
roborev fix 123                    # Fix a specific review by job ID
roborev fix 42 43 44               # Fix multiple reviews sequentially
roborev fix --batch                # Batch all unaddressed into one agent prompt
roborev fix --batch 42 43 44       # Batch specific jobs into one prompt
```

The agent reads the review findings, applies changes, commits, and marks the review as addressed. This is a one-shot fix. For an iterative loop with re-review, see [`roborev refine`](/guides/auto-fixing/).

Use `--batch` to concatenate multiple reviews into a single prompt so the agent sees all findings at once. This is faster and gives the agent more context to make coordinated fixes across related issues. Reviews are packed into batches respecting the configured max prompt size.

## Applying Fixes from Analysis

There are two ways to apply fixes from analysis results.

### Inline with `--fix`

Add `--fix` to run analysis and then immediately invoke an agent to apply the suggested changes:

```bash
roborev analyze refactor --fix ./...
roborev analyze duplication --fix --fix-agent claude-code src/
```

When combined with `--per-file`, files are analyzed and fixed sequentially:

```bash
roborev analyze complexity --per-file --fix 'internal/storage/*.go'
```

### Separately with `roborev fix`

Run analysis first, review the results, then apply fixes for specific jobs:

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze
roborev analyze test-fixtures 'internal/storage/*_test.go'
# => Job 42

# Step 2: Review findings in TUI or with roborev show
roborev show 42

# Step 3: Apply fixes
roborev fix 42
```

Fix multiple jobs sequentially:

```bash
roborev fix 42 43 44
```

Or batch them into a single agent prompt for faster, more coordinated fixes:

```bash
roborev fix --batch 42 43 44
```

When complete, the agent commits its changes and the jobs are marked as addressed.

### Batch Analyze, Then Fix

Queue multiple analysis jobs at once and let `roborev fix` work through them all:

```bash
# Queue a batch of analysis jobs
roborev analyze test-fixtures 'internal/*_test.go'
roborev analyze duplication internal/
roborev analyze complexity --per-file 'cmd/*.go'

# Fix all unaddressed reviews (analysis results are reviews too)
roborev fix

# Or batch all unaddressed into a single agent prompt
roborev fix --batch
```

Without `--batch`, `roborev fix` processes unaddressed reviews one at a time. As it commits fixes, the daemon automatically reviews the new commits, and if those new reviews fail, `roborev fix` picks them up and addresses them too. This means a single `roborev fix` invocation can work through a chain of analysis findings and their follow-on reviews without manual intervention.

With `--batch`, all unaddressed reviews are concatenated into a single prompt (respecting the configured max prompt size), so the agent addresses everything in one pass. This is particularly useful after queuing several analysis jobs.

## Stream Output

When `roborev fix` or `analyze --fix` runs an agent, output is formatted as compact progress lines showing tool calls:

```
Read   internal/gmail/ratelimit_test.go
Edit   internal/gmail/ratelimit_test.go
Bash   go test ./internal/gmail/ -run TestRateLimiter
Edit   internal/gmail/ratelimit_test.go
Grep   TODO  internal/
```

When piped (non-TTY), raw JSON is passed through for logging or scripting:

```bash
roborev fix 42 | tee fix-log.json
```

## JSON Output

Use `--json` for programmatic output, useful for agent-driven workflows:

```bash
roborev analyze refactor --json 'cmd/*.go'
```

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {"id": 1, "agent": "codex"}
  ],
  "analysis_type": "refactor",
  "files": ["main.go"]
}
```

In `--per-file` mode, each job includes a `file` field:

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {"id": 1, "agent": "codex", "file": "a.go"},
    {"id": 2, "agent": "codex", "file": "b.go"}
  ],
  "analysis_type": "complexity",
  "files": ["a.go", "b.go"]
}
```

## Large File Handling

When file content exceeds the configured prompt size limit (default 200KB), roborev switches to **agentic mode** automatically. Instead of embedding file contents in the prompt, it passes file paths and lets the agent read them directly.

Configure the limit in `config.toml`:

```toml
default_max_prompt_size = 204800   # bytes (default: 200KB)
```

Or per-repository in `.roborev.toml`:

```toml
max_prompt_size = 204800
```
