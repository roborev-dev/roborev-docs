title: Auto-Fix with Refine
description: Iterative review-fix loop that keeps going until all reviews pass
---

`roborev refine` is a fully automated loop: it finds failed reviews on your branch, runs an agent to fix them, waits for re-review, and repeats until everything passes or the iteration limit is reached.

For a one-shot fix without re-review, see [`roborev fix`](/guides/assisted-refactoring/#using-fix-with-reviews).

```bash
roborev refine                       # Fix failed reviews using default agent
roborev refine --agent claude-code   # Use specific agent
roborev refine --max-iterations 5    # Limit iterations (default: 10)
roborev refine --quiet               # Show elapsed time instead of agent output
roborev refine --reasoning thorough  # Thorough reasoning (slower, more accurate)
roborev refine --since abc123        # Refine commits since a specific commit
roborev refine --since HEAD~3        # Refine the last 3 commits
```

## What Refine Does

1. Finds the **oldest failed review** on your branch
2. Runs an agent in an **isolated worktree** to address the findings
3. If the agent makes changes, applies them and **commits**
4. **Waits for re-review** of the new commit
5. If the new commit fails review, addresses those findings too
6. Once all per-commit reviews pass, runs a **whole-branch review**
7. If the branch review passes, exits successfully
8. If the branch review fails, addresses those findings and loops back

If the agent makes no changes for a review, that review is skipped and refine moves on to the next failed review.

## Refine vs Fix

| | `roborev fix` | `roborev refine` |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | One-shot fix, no re-review | Iterative loop with re-review |
| **Commit review** | Enqueues but doesn't wait | Waits and re-addresses if failed |
| **Branch review** | No | Runs after all commits pass |
| **Isolation** | Runs synchronously in the foreground, directly on your working tree | Uses a temp worktree per iteration, commits to your branch when each iteration completes |
| **Use case** | Quick fix for a known issue | Polish a branch before merge |

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--agent <name>` | Agent to use for fixes |
| `--model <model>` | Model for agent |
| `--max-iterations <n>` | Maximum fix iterations (default: 10) |
| `--quiet` | Show elapsed time instead of agent output |
| `--reasoning <level>` | Reasoning depth: fast, standard, thorough |
| `--fast` | Shorthand for `--reasoning fast` |
| `--since <commit>` | Refine commits since a specific commit |
| `--allow-unsafe-agents` | Allow agents without sandboxing |

## Requirements

- **Clean working tree**: No uncommitted changes
- **Feature branch**: By default, compares against the default branch
- **Use `--since`**: To refine specific commits on any branch, including main

## Security Considerations

The refine command runs AI agents **without sandboxing** so they can install dependencies, run builds, and execute tests. This is safe for your own code, but use caution with untrusted sources:

| Scenario | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Your own branches | Low | Safe to run directly |
| PRs from trusted contributors | Low-Medium | Review changes before refining |
| PRs from strangers / untrusted code | High | Use isolation (see below) |

### Isolation Options for Untrusted Code

- Run in a container or VM
- Use a low-privilege user account
- Use a disposable cloud instance

:::caution
The risk is equivalent to running `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` or `codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` manually - malicious code could potentially access credentials, exfiltrate data, or modify your system.
