Manage repositories tracked by roborev:

<video src="/cli-repo-list.webm" autoplay muted loop playsinline />

```bash
roborev repo list                    # List all repos with review counts
roborev repo show my-project         # Show repo details and stats
roborev repo rename old-name new-name # Rename display name
roborev repo delete old-project      # Remove from tracking
roborev repo merge source target     # Merge reviews into another repo
```

## Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `repo list` | List all repositories with review counts |
| `repo show <name>` | Show detailed stats for a repository |
| `repo rename <old> <new>` | Rename a repository's display name |
| `repo delete <name>` | Remove repository from tracking |
| `repo merge <src> <dst>` | Move all reviews to another repo |

## Common Use Cases

### Rename for Clarity

The rename command is useful when you want a friendlier display name than the directory name:

```bash
roborev repo rename my-project-v2 "My Project"
```

### Consolidate Duplicates

The merge command consolidates duplicate entries (e.g., from symlinks or path changes):

```bash
# Reviews from /home/user/projects/myapp are stored under "myapp"
# Reviews from /home/user/work/myapp are stored under "myapp-1"
roborev repo merge myapp-1 myapp
```

### Clean Up Old Projects

```bash
roborev repo list                 # See all tracked repos
roborev repo delete old-project   # Remove one you no longer need
```

## How Repositories Are Tracked

roborev automatically creates a repository entry when you:

1. Run `roborev init` in a repo
2. Queue a review for a commit in a new repo
3. Run any roborev command in an untracked repo

The default display name is the directory name. You can customize this with:

```toml
# .roborev.toml in your repo
display_name = "My Custom Name"
```
