Reviews are designed to be fed back into your AI coding agent sessions to address findings. The quickest way is `roborev fix`, which runs an agent to apply changes automatically. You can also copy reviews into an agent session manually, or add comments for context.

## Auto-Fix with `roborev fix`

Let an agent address findings automatically. `roborev fix` runs **synchronously in the foreground**: it blocks until the agent finishes and applies changes directly to your working tree.

```bash
roborev fix                        # Fix all unaddressed reviews on this branch
roborev fix 123                    # Fix a specific review by job ID
roborev fix --batch                # Batch all unaddressed into one agent prompt
```

The agent reads the review, applies changes, commits, and marks the review as addressed. This is a one-shot fix. For an iterative loop with re-review, see [Auto-Fix with Refine](/guides/auto-fixing/).

## Copying Reviews

Press `y` in the TUI to copy the full review content to your clipboard. Paste it into an AI coding agent session to address the findings. You can also share reviews with teammates, include them in GitHub issues, or reference them in commit messages.

## Adding a Comment

### From the TUI

Press `c` from either the queue view or review detail view to open the comment modal:

1. Navigate to the review you want to comment on
2. Press `c` to open the comment modal
3. Type your comment (multi-line supported)
4. Press `Enter` to submit, or `Esc` to cancel

### From the CLI

```bash
roborev comment <review-id> "Your comment text"
```

Or interactively:

```bash
roborev comment <review-id>
# Opens your $EDITOR for multi-line input
```

## How Comments Are Used

When the AI reviews the same commit again (or related commits), your comments are included in the prompt:

- **Context about known issues**: "This null check is intentional, handled in caller"
- **Clarifications**: "This is test code, different standards apply"
- **Acknowledgments**: "Good catch, will fix in next commit"

<Aside type="tip">
Comments help train the AI's understanding of your codebase conventions and reduce false positives in future reviews.

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Reference line numbers and specific findings
2. **Explain the "why"**: Help the AI understand your reasoning
3. **Acknowledge valid findings**: Confirm when the AI catches real issues
4. **Note false positives**: Mark findings that don't apply to your context

## Example Comments

```
The singleton pattern here is intentional for the connection pool.
Thread safety is handled by the underlying driver.
```

```
This is generated code from protobuf - we don't modify it directly.
Please ignore style issues in *.pb.go files.
```

```
Good catch on the race condition! I'll add a mutex in the next commit.
```
