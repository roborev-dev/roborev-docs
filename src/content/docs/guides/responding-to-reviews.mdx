title: Responding to Reviews
description: Add comments and context to reviews for future AI consideration

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

When the AI reviewer misses context or makes incorrect assumptions, you can add responses that will be included in future review prompts. This creates a feedback loop where the AI learns from your corrections.

## Adding a Response

### From the TUI

Press `c` from either the queue view or review detail view to open the respond modal:

1. Navigate to the review you want to respond to
2. Press `c` to open the respond modal
3. Type your response (multi-line supported)
4. Press `Enter` to submit, or `Esc` to cancel

### From the CLI

```bash
roborev respond <review-id> "Your response text"
```

Or interactively:

```bash
roborev respond <review-id>
# Opens your $EDITOR for multi-line input
```

## How Responses Are Used

When the AI reviews the same commit again (or related commits), your responses are included in the prompt:

- **Context about known issues**: "This null check is intentional, handled in caller"
- **Clarifications**: "This is test code, different standards apply"
- **Acknowledgments**: "Good catch, will fix in next commit"

<Aside type="tip">
Responses help train the AI's understanding of your codebase conventions and reduce false positives in future reviews.

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Reference line numbers and specific findings
2. **Explain the "why"**: Help the AI understand your reasoning
3. **Acknowledge valid findings**: Confirm when the AI catches real issues
4. **Note false positives**: Mark findings that don't apply to your context

## Example Responses

```
The singleton pattern here is intentional for the connection pool.
Thread safety is handled by the underlying driver.
```

```
This is generated code from protobuf - we don't modify it directly.
Please ignore style issues in *.pb.go files.
```

```
Good catch on the race condition! I'll add a mutex in the next commit.
```
