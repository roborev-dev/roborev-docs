title: Reviewing Branches
description: Review all commits on a feature branch before merging
---

Use `--branch` to review all commits since your branch diverged from main:

```bash
roborev review --branch              # Review branch vs auto-detected main/master
roborev review --branch --base dev   # Review branch vs specific base
roborev review --branch --wait       # Wait for review and show result
```

This is useful for pre-merge reviews of entire feature branches.

## How It Works

1. roborev detects the merge-base between your current branch and the base branch
2. All commits from the merge-base to HEAD are queued for review
3. Each commit is reviewed individually by the AI agent
4. Results are stored and can be viewed in the TUI

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--base <branch>` | Compare against a specific base branch (default: auto-detect main/master) |
| `--wait` | Wait for all reviews to complete |
| `--quiet` | Suppress output |
| `--agent <name>` | Use specific agent |
| `--reasoning <level>` | Set reasoning depth |

## Use Cases

### Pre-Merge Review

Before creating a pull request, review your entire branch:

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
roborev review --branch --wait
roborev fix           # Address any failed reviews
roborev tui           # Browse results
```

### CI Integration

```bash
if ! roborev review --branch --wait --quiet; then
    echo "Reviews found issues"
    exit 1
fi
```
