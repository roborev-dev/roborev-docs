title: Reviewing Uncommitted Changes
description: Review your working tree changes before committing
---

Use `--dirty` to review working tree changes before committing:

```bash
roborev review --dirty           # Queue review of uncommitted changes
roborev review --dirty --wait    # Wait for review and show result
```

## What Gets Reviewed

The `--dirty` flag includes:

- Staged changes
- Unstaged changes to tracked files
- Untracked files

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--wait` | Wait for review to complete |
| `--quiet` | Suppress output |
| `--agent <name>` | Use specific agent |
| `--reasoning <level>` | Set reasoning depth |

## Exit Codes

The `--wait` flag exits with:
- Code 0 for passing reviews
- Code 1 for failing reviews

This is useful for CI or pre-commit workflows:

```bash
if ! roborev review --dirty --wait --quiet; then
    echo "Review failed - please address findings"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Reviewing Specific Commits

Use `--since` to review commits since a specific point:

```bash
roborev review --since HEAD~5       # Review last 5 commits
roborev review --since abc123       # Review commits since abc123 (exclusive)
roborev review --since v1.0.0       # Review commits since a tag
```

The range is exclusive of the starting commit (like git's `..` range syntax). Unlike `--branch`, this works on any branch including main.

## Large Diffs

For `--dirty` reviews, diffs are limited to 200KB since uncommitted changes cannot be easily inspected by the agent. If your dirty diff exceeds this limit, commit your changes in smaller chunks.

For committed changes, diffs over 250KB are omitted from the prompt - the agent is given only the commit hash and can inspect changes using `git show`.
