import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://roborev.io/install.sh | bash
```

Then from within your git repositories:

```bash
roborev init && roborev tui
```

For Windows, see the [installation guide](/installation/#quick-install-recommended).

## Why roborev?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Automatic Reviews" icon="pencil"> Continuously reviews
    your agents' commits while you work via git hooks for rapid
    feedback. Or manually request custom reviews via the CLI.  </Card>
  <Card title="Stay In Control" icon="laptop">
    `roborev` is not an agent orchestrator. You decide how to
    incorporate reviews into your workflow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Agent Support" icon="rocket">
    Works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode, and Droid. Auto-detects installed agents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local & Private" icon="laptop">
    Local-first experience, review earlier and faster than GitHub
    PRs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auto-Fix with Refine" icon="setting">
    `roborev refine` allows for autonomously addressing reviews in a
    branch or commit range with your preferred agent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Player, Multi-Machine" icon="laptop">
    Bi-directionally sync review data to a shared PostgreSQL database.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Architecture

<img src="/architecture.svg" alt="roborev architecture diagram" class="diagram-center" />

- **Daemon**: HTTP server on port 7373 (auto-finds available port if busy)
- **Workers**: Pool of 4 (configurable) parallel review workers
- **Storage**: SQLite at `~/.roborev/reviews.db` with WAL mode
- **Config**: Global at `~/.roborev/config.toml`, per-repo at `.roborev.toml`

## Federated Multiplayer

<img src="/federation.svg" alt="roborev federation diagram" class="diagram-center" />

Bi-directionally sync reviews across machines with a shared PostgreSQL database. Each daemon maintains its local SQLite for fast access while syncing changes to the central database.
