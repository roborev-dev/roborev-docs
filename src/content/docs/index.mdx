## Why roborev?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Automatic Reviews" icon="pencil"> Continuously reviews
    your agents' commits while you work via git hooks. Or manually
    request custom reviews via the CLI.  </Card>
  <Card title="Stay In Control" icon="laptop">
    `roborev` is not an agent orchestrator. You decide how to
    incorporate reviews into your workflow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Agent Support" icon="rocket">
    Works with Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, Copilot, and OpenCode. Auto-detects installed agents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local & Private" icon="laptop">
    Local-first experience, review earlier and faster than GitHub
    PRs. 
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auto-Fix with Refine" icon="setting">
    `roborev refine` allows for autonomously addressing reviews in a
    branch or commit range with your preferred agent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Player, Multi-Machine" icon="laptop">
    Bi-directionally sync review data to a shared PostgreSQL database.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesm/roborev/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Or with Go:

```bash
go install github.com/wesm/roborev/cmd/roborev@latest
```

## Architecture

```
CLI (roborev) -> HTTP API -> Daemon (roborev daemon run) -> Worker Pool -> Agents
                                |
                            SQLite DB
```

- **Daemon**: HTTP server on port 7373 (auto-finds available port if busy)
- **Workers**: Pool of 4 (configurable) parallel review workers
- **Storage**: SQLite at `~/.roborev/reviews.db` with WAL mode
- **Config**: Global at `~/.roborev/config.toml`, per-repo at `.roborev.toml`
