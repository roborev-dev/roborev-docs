description: Using roborev with git worktrees
---

roborev fully supports git worktrees. Reviews are stored against the main repository, so commits made in any worktree are associated with the same review history.

## Usage

```bash
# In main repo
git worktree add ../feature-branch feature-branch
cd ../feature-branch

# Reviews work normally - they're stored under the main repo
roborev review --branch
roborev refine
roborev tui
```

## How It Works

When running commands from a worktree:

- Reviews are stored using the **main repository path** (not the worktree path)
- The TUI shows all reviews for the repository regardless of which worktree you're in
- `refine` correctly finds and addresses reviews for commits in any worktree

This is handled automatically - no configuration needed.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# You're working on main
cd ~/projects/myapp
roborev tui  # Shows all reviews

# Create a worktree for a feature branch
git worktree add ~/projects/myapp-feature feature-branch
cd ~/projects/myapp-feature

# Make commits - reviews are tracked under myapp
git commit -m "Add feature"

# View all reviews (same database)
roborev tui

# Run refine in the worktree
roborev refine

# Clean up when done
cd ~/projects/myapp
git worktree remove ~/projects/myapp-feature
```

## Why This Matters

Without worktree support, you'd have:
- Duplicate repository entries in the database
- Scattered reviews across different paths
- Confusion about which reviews belong to which code

With proper worktree support, everything is consolidated under the main repository.
