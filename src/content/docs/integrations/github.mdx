description: Automatically review GitHub PRs and post results as bot comments
---

roborev can poll GitHub for open pull requests, run code reviews on each one, and post the results as PR comments.

## How It Works

The CI poller runs inside the roborev daemon. On each interval it:

1. Lists open PRs for each configured repo via `gh pr list`
2. Skips PRs that have already been reviewed at their current HEAD SHA
3. Fetches the PR head commit (including fork-based PRs)
4. Computes the merge-base range (`base..head`) and enqueues review jobs
5. When all reviews complete, posts the result as a PR comment

For multi-agent or multi-type configurations, results from all jobs are synthesized by an LLM into a single combined PR comment. When only one job is configured, the output is posted directly (no synthesis overhead).

## What to Expect

Before enabling the CI poller, understand the following:

- **The poller reviews ALL open PRs on first start.** It polls immediately on startup, not after the first interval. If you have 20 open PRs, all 20 will be enqueued for review right away. Subsequent polls only review PRs with new commits (tracked by HEAD SHA in the local database).
- **All open PRs are reviewed.** There is no filtering by draft status, labels, or author. Draft PRs, bot PRs, and stale PRs all get reviewed.
- **CI settings are global by default, with per-repo overrides.** The `agents`, `review_types`, and `model` in the global `[ci]` section apply to every repo unless overridden. Individual repos can override agents, review types, and reasoning level via the `[ci]` section in their `.roborev.toml` (see [Per-Repo Overrides](#per-repo-overrides)).
- **Reviews run with `max_workers` concurrency** (default: 4). Jobs are enqueued immediately but executed up to 4 at a time. With a multi-agent matrix, a single PR can generate multiple jobs (e.g. 2 types x 2 agents = 4 jobs).
- **The daemon does not survive reboots.** Use `roborev daemon start` to run in the background, but you'll need a launchd agent (macOS) or systemd service (Linux) if you want it to start on boot.

:::caution[First-run with many open PRs]
If you're enabling the CI poller on a repo with many open PRs, consider temporarily setting `repos` to a test repo first, verifying it works, and then adding your real repos. This avoids an unexpected burst of review jobs and PR comments.
:::

## Choose Your Authentication Method

roborev needs GitHub credentials to list PRs and post comments. There are two options:

| | GitHub App (Recommended) | Personal (`gh` CLI) |
|---|---|---|
| **Comments appear as** | `your-app-name[bot]` | Your personal GitHub account |
| **Setup effort** | Create an app, generate keys, install on repos | Minimal: just `gh auth login` |
| **Best for** | Teams, shared repos, production use | Quick testing, personal projects |
| **Permissions** | Scoped to specific repos and permissions | Whatever your account has access to |

:::tip[Which should I pick?]
**GitHub App** is the recommended approach: dedicated bot identity, scoped permissions, and clean separation from your personal account. Use **personal auth** if you just want to try roborev quickly without creating an app.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before enabling the CI poller, you need:

1. **`gh` CLI** installed (roborev shells out to `gh` for PR listing and comment posting):
   ```bash
   # Install: https://cli.github.com/
   gh --version   # verify it's installed
   ```

   If you're using **GitHub App auth**, `gh` does not need to be separately authenticated. The app token is injected automatically. If you're using **personal auth**, you also need to log in:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   gh auth status   # verify it worked
   ```

   If your organization uses SSO with personal auth, make sure your token is authorized for SSO access. The daemon runs long-lived. If your `gh` token expires while the daemon is running, the poller will log errors and skip repos until you re-authenticate.

2. **A local checkout** of each repo you want to poll (optional for CI-only setups):
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/myrepo
   roborev init              # starts daemon automatically
   roborev init --no-daemon  # if using systemd/launchd to manage the daemon
   ```
   The poller matches GitHub repos to local checkouts by git remote URL. If no local checkout is found, the poller automatically clones the repo to `~/.roborev/clones/{owner}/{repo}` and uses that clone for reviews. A missing git origin remote is treated as a confirmed mismatch (triggering auto-clone) rather than a transient error.

   If you do provide a local checkout, it must use `origin` as its remote name (the default). The poller runs `git fetch origin` and `git fetch origin pull/<number>/head` to retrieve PR commits, including those from contributor forks.

3. **At least one AI agent** installed. The poller auto-detects installed agents in this order: `codex`, `claude-code`, `gemini`, `copilot`, `cursor`, `opencode`, `droid`. You can check what's available with:
   ```bash
   roborev check-agents             # smoke-test all installed agents
   roborev check-agents --agent codex  # test a specific agent
   ```
   Or set a specific agent in the `[ci]` config (see below).

## Setup with GitHub App (Recommended)

PR comments will appear as **your-app-name[bot]** with scoped permissions.

### 1. Create the GitHub App

Go to **GitHub Settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps > New GitHub App**.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **App name** | A globally unique name, e.g. `roborev-myorg` (this becomes the `[bot]` username) |
| **Homepage URL** | Your repo URL or any URL |
| **Webhook** | Uncheck "Active" (not needed -- roborev polls) |

Under **Repository permissions**, set:

- **Pull requests**: Read & write
- **Contents**: Read-only

Leave everything else as "No access". Click **Create GitHub App**.

:::important[If app permissions are currently empty]
If you already created the app with empty permissions:

1. Open app settings and go to **Permissions & events**.
2. Set **Pull requests** to **Read and write** and **Contents** to **Read-only**.
3. Save the app settings.
4. For each existing installation, open installation settings and **accept the updated permissions**.

Until each installation accepts the new permissions, roborev may fail to list PR data or post PR comments.
:::

:::tip
Set the app visibility to **Any account** if you want others to install it on their repos. This is under the app's **Advanced** settings after creation.
:::

### 2. Note the App ID

After creation, the **App ID** is shown near the top of the app settings page. You'll need this for `github_app_id`.

### 3. Generate a Private Key

On the app settings page, scroll to **Private keys** and click **Generate a private key**. Your browser downloads a `.pem` file. Store it securely:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.roborev
# The downloaded file will be named something like your-app-name.2026-02-08.private-key.pem
mv ~/Downloads/your-app-name.*.private-key.pem ~/.roborev/roborev.pem
chmod 600 ~/.roborev/roborev.pem
```

### 4. Install the App on Your Repos

From the app settings page, click **Install App** in the left sidebar. Choose the account or organization that owns your repos, and select which repositories to grant access to.

After installing, note the **installation ID** from the URL:

```
https://github.com/settings/installations/12345678
                                           ^^^^^^^^
                                           this is your installation ID
```

If you have repos across multiple organizations or user accounts, install the app on each one. Each installation gets its own installation ID. You'll need these for the [multi-installation config](#multiple-installations) below.

### 5. Add CI config

Add to `~/.roborev/config.toml`:

```toml
[ci]
enabled = true
poll_interval = "5m"
repos = ["myorg/myrepo"]
agents = ["codex"]
review_types = ["security"]

# GitHub App authentication
github_app_id = 123456
github_app_private_key = "~/.roborev/roborev.pem"
github_app_installation_id = 12345678
```

The `github_app_private_key` field accepts:

- A file path: `~/.roborev/roborev.pem` (tilde is expanded)
- An environment variable: `${ROBOREV_APP_KEY}` (expands to a path or inline PEM content)
- Inline PEM content (starting with `-----BEGIN`)

:::caution[Avoid inline PEM in config files]
Prefer a file path or `${ENV_VAR}` reference over inline PEM content. Inline keys are easy to commit to version control accidentally. Make sure your config file is excluded from VCS (the global config at `~/.roborev/config.toml` is outside your repo by default).
:::

App auth requires `github_app_id`, `github_app_private_key`, and at least one installation ID (either `github_app_installation_id` or entries in `github_app_installations`). If none are configured, the poller falls back to your personal `gh` auth.

#### Multiple Installations

If your repos span multiple GitHub organizations or user accounts, each one has its own app installation with a separate installation ID. Use the `[ci.github_app_installations]` table to map each owner to its installation ID:

```toml
[ci]
enabled = true
repos = ["wesm/my-project", "roborev-dev/core"]

github_app_id = 123456
github_app_private_key = "~/.roborev/roborev.pem"

[ci.github_app_installations]
wesm = 111111
roborev-dev = 222222
```

The poller extracts the owner from each repo (the part before `/`) and looks up the matching installation ID. Owner matching is case-insensitive, so `wesm` matches repos listed as `Wesm/repo` or `WESM/repo`.

You can also mix the map with the singular `github_app_installation_id` as a fallback for owners not in the map:

```toml
[ci]
github_app_id = 123456
github_app_private_key = "~/.roborev/roborev.pem"
github_app_installation_id = 111111   # fallback for unlisted owners

[ci.github_app_installations]
roborev-dev = 222222                  # this org uses a different installation
```

Each installation gets its own cached access token, so there is no performance penalty for multiple installations.

### 6. Start the daemon and verify

```bash
roborev daemon start        # background mode
roborev daemon run          # or foreground mode to watch logs
```

Look for the log line:

```
CI poller: GitHub App authentication enabled (app_id=123456)
```

PR comments will now appear as **your-app-name[bot]**.

## Setup with Personal Auth

If you don't want to create a GitHub App, you can use your personal `gh` CLI login instead. PR comments will appear as your GitHub account.

### 1. Add CI config

Add to `~/.roborev/config.toml` (make sure you've already run `roborev init` in your local checkout per [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)):

```toml
[ci]
enabled = true
poll_interval = "5m"
repos = ["myorg/myrepo"]
agents = ["codex"]              # which agents to use (or omit for auto-detect)
review_types = ["security"]     # "security", "design", or "default"
```

> `"default"` runs the standard code review (bugs, security, testing gaps, regressions, code quality), the same as `roborev review` without `--type`. The aliases `"review"` and `"general"` are also accepted. Note that the CI config defaults to `["security"]` if `review_types` is not set.

No `github_app_*` fields needed. The daemon posts comments using whatever account `gh auth` is logged in as.

### 2. Start the daemon

```bash
roborev daemon start        # background mode
roborev daemon run          # or foreground mode to watch logs
```

## Verifying It Works

On startup you should see:

```
CI poller started (interval: 5m0s, repos: [myorg/myrepo])
```

The poller checks for open PRs immediately, then on each interval. When a review completes, you'll see:

```
CI poller: posted review comment on myorg/myrepo#42 (job 123, verdict=P)
```

Use `roborev status` to check the daemon and queue state at any time.

:::note[CI reasoning level]
The CI poller defaults to `reasoning = "thorough"` for all review jobs. You can override this per-repo with a `[ci]` section in the repo's `.roborev.toml` (see [Per-Repo Overrides](#per-repo-overrides)).
:::

## Commit Status Checks

When GitHub App authentication is configured, the CI poller posts commit status checks on each PR's head commit. These appear as check entries on the PR and in the commit status list on GitHub.

The status context is `roborev` and progresses through these states:

| State | When |
|-------|------|
| `pending` | Review jobs are queued or running |
| `success` | All reviews passed |
| `failure` | One or more reviews found issues or failed |

Status checks require the **Commit statuses: Read and write** permission on your GitHub App. If you created the app following the setup guide above, add this permission:

1. Open your GitHub App settings and go to **Permissions & events**
2. Under **Repository permissions**, set **Commit statuses** to **Read and write**
3. Save and accept the updated permissions on each installation

If no GitHub App is configured, or the app lacks the commit statuses permission, status checks are silently skipped. PR comments are still posted regardless.

:::note
Status checks are posted per-commit, not per-job. When a multi-agent matrix produces several jobs for the same PR, the status reflects the aggregate result: `success` only if all jobs pass.
:::

## Keeping the Daemon Running

`roborev daemon start` runs the daemon in the background, but it won't survive a reboot. For persistent operation, set up a system service.

:::caution[Use `--no-daemon` with system services]
If you manage the daemon with systemd or launchd, use `roborev init --no-daemon` when registering repos. Otherwise, `roborev init` auto-starts a background daemon that conflicts with the service-managed one.
:::

**macOS (launchd):**

```bash
# Create log directory and plist (adjust the path to the roborev binary)
mkdir -p ~/Library/Logs/roborev
cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.roborev.daemon.plist << 'EOF'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.roborev.daemon</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/local/bin/roborev</string>
        <string>daemon</string>
        <string>run</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>

    <string>/Users/YOU/Library/Logs/roborev/daemon.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF

launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.roborev.daemon.plist
```

Replace `/Users/YOU` with your home directory. Launchd does not expand `~` in plist values.

**Linux (systemd):**

```bash
# Resolve the actual binary path for ExecStart
ROBOREV_BIN="$(command -v roborev)"

mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cat > ~/.config/systemd/user/roborev.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=roborev daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=${ROBOREV_BIN} daemon run
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
EOF

systemctl --user enable --now roborev
```

## Wildcard Repository Patterns

Instead of listing every repository individually, you can use glob patterns in `ci.repos` to match multiple repos under an owner. The owner part (before the `/`) must be literal.

```toml
[ci]
enabled = true
repos = [
  "myorg/*",           # All repos under myorg
  "myorg/api-*",       # Only repos starting with "api-"
  "other/specific",    # Exact repo still works
]

# Exclude repos matching these patterns
exclude_repos = ["myorg/archived-*", "myorg/internal-*"]

# Safety cap on total expanded repos (default: 100)
max_repos = 50
```

Patterns use Go's `path.Match` syntax (`*` matches any sequence of characters, `?` matches a single character, `[...]` matches character classes). Matching is case-insensitive.

Wildcard expansion calls the GitHub API (`gh repo list`) and caches results for one hour. Archived repos are automatically excluded from the API results. Explicit (non-wildcard) repos always take priority when `max_repos` is reached.

Exclusion patterns in `exclude_repos` apply to both exact entries and wildcard-expanded entries.

## Multi-Review Types and Agents

You can configure multiple review types and agents to run in parallel for each PR. The CI poller creates a matrix of jobs (review_types x agents) and posts a single synthesized comment when all jobs complete.

```toml
[ci]
enabled = true
poll_interval = "5m"
repos = ["myorg/myrepo"]

# Run both security and standard code reviews
review_types = ["security", "default"]

# Use multiple agents
agents = ["codex", "gemini"]

# This creates 4 jobs per PR (2 types x 2 agents)
```

When the matrix is 1x1 (single review type, single agent), synthesis is skipped and the output is posted directly.

### Synthesis

When multiple jobs complete, their outputs are combined by an LLM synthesis step into a single well-formatted PR comment. The synthesis agent:

- Deduplicates findings reported by multiple agents
- Organizes findings by severity
- Preserves file and line references
- Produces a one-line summary verdict

You can customize the synthesis behavior:

```toml
[ci]
synthesis_agent = "claude-code"                  # Agent to use for synthesis
synthesis_model = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"   # Model override for synthesis
```

If synthesis fails, roborev falls back to posting all review outputs in collapsible `<details>` blocks.

## Per-Repo Overrides

Individual repos can override the global CI settings by adding a `[ci]` section to their `.roborev.toml` file. This lets you run different agents, review types, or reasoning levels for different repos.

```toml
# .roborev.toml (in repo root)

agent = "codex"   # agent for post-commit reviews (unrelated to CI)

[ci]
agents = ["gemini"]                  # override agents for CI reviews of this repo
review_types = ["security", "default"]  # override review types
reasoning = "standard"               # override reasoning level (thorough, standard, fast)
```

Per-repo overrides take priority over the global `[ci]` config. Any field not set in the repo's `[ci]` section falls back to the global config.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `agents` | array | global `agents` | Agents for CI reviews of this repo |
| `review_types` | array | global `review_types` | Review types for CI reviews of this repo |
| `reasoning` | string | `"thorough"` | Reasoning level: `thorough`, `standard`, or `fast` |
| `min_severity` | string | `"low"` | Minimum severity to include: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical` |

## CI Options Reference

### Core Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Enable the CI poller |
| `poll_interval` | string | `"5m"` | How often to check for PRs (minimum 30s, invalid values default to 5m) |
| `repos` | array | `[]` | GitHub repos to poll in `"owner/repo"` format. Supports glob patterns (e.g. `"myorg/*"`, `"myorg/api-*"`). |
| `exclude_repos` | array | `[]` | Glob patterns to exclude from the resolved repo list |
| `max_repos` | int | `100` | Safety cap on total expanded repos (explicit repos have priority over wildcard-expanded ones) |
| `review_types` | array | `["security"]` | Review types to run for each PR: `security`, `design`, or `default`. `"review"` and `"general"` are accepted as aliases for `"default"`. |
| `agents` | array | auto-detect | Agents to run for each PR (e.g., `["codex", "gemini"]`) |
| `model` | string | | Model override for CI reviews |
| `min_severity` | string | `"low"` | Minimum severity to include in output: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical` |
| `synthesis_agent` | string | | Agent for combining multi-job results |
| `synthesis_model` | string | | Model override for synthesis |

When `agents` is empty, the poller auto-detects the first available agent from: codex, claude-code, gemini, copilot, cursor, opencode, droid.

### GitHub App Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `github_app_id` | integer | App ID from the app settings page |
| `github_app_private_key` | string | Path to PEM file, `${ENV_VAR}`, or inline PEM |
| `github_app_installation_id` | integer | Installation ID (fallback for owners not in the installations map) |
| `github_app_installations` | table | Map of owner name to installation ID for multi-org setups (see [Multiple Installations](#multiple-installations)) |

App auth requires `github_app_id`, `github_app_private_key`, and at least one installation ID (either `github_app_installation_id` or entries in `github_app_installations`). If none are configured, the poller falls back to default `gh` authentication. For repos whose owner has no matching installation ID, the poller also falls back to default `gh` auth for that repo.

## Troubleshooting

The daemon logs to stdout (or to the log file if using a system service). Common issues:

**"no local repo found matching..."**
You need to run `roborev init` in a local checkout of the repo. The poller matches GitHub `owner/repo` to local repos by git remote URL.

**"gh pr list: ..."**
The `gh` CLI is not installed, not authenticated, or doesn't have access to the repo. Run `gh auth status` and `gh pr list --repo owner/repo` to debug. If your org uses SSO, re-authorize your token with `gh auth refresh`.

**"merge-base ... : ..."**
The PR's base or head commit isn't available locally. This usually means `git fetch` failed. Check that the local repo has the remote configured correctly.

**"GitHub App token failed, falling back to default gh auth"**
The GitHub App authentication failed. Check that your PEM file path is correct, the app is installed on the repo, and the installation ID matches. The daemon falls back to your `gh` CLI auth. If you're also logged in via `gh auth login`, PR operations will still work but comments will appear as your personal account. If you're not logged in, `gh` commands will fail.

**"no installation ID for owner ..., using default gh auth"**
The poller found no installation ID for this repo's owner. If you're using `[ci.github_app_installations]`, add an entry for the owner. If you're using the singular `github_app_installation_id`, make sure it's set. Owner names are matched case-insensitively, so `wesm` and `Wesm` are equivalent.

**No log output at all for CI**
Check that `[ci] enabled = true` is in `~/.roborev/config.toml` and that the daemon was restarted after adding it. The `[ci]` section requires a daemon restart to take effect.

**Reviews enqueue but never complete**
Check `roborev status` to see if jobs are queued/running. The agent may be failing -- check the daemon logs for error messages from the agent.

**Unexpected review burst on first start**
This is normal. The poller reviews all open PRs on first startup. After the initial run, only PRs with new commits (different HEAD SHA) trigger new reviews. The tracking is persistent across daemon restarts.

## Full Examples

### GitHub App -- Single Review

```toml
[ci]
enabled = true
poll_interval = "5m"
repos = ["myorg/backend", "myorg/frontend"]
review_types = ["security"]
agents = ["claude-code"]
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"

github_app_id = 123456
github_app_private_key = "~/.roborev/roborev.pem"
github_app_installation_id = 12345678
```

### GitHub App -- Multi-Agent Matrix

```toml
[ci]
enabled = true
poll_interval = "5m"
repos = ["myorg/backend"]

# 2x2 matrix = 4 jobs per PR
review_types = ["security", "default"]
agents = ["codex", "gemini"]

# Synthesis settings
synthesis_agent = "claude-code"
synthesis_model = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"

github_app_id = 123456
github_app_private_key = "${ROBOREV_APP_KEY}"
github_app_installation_id = 12345678
```

### GitHub App -- Multiple Installations

```toml
[ci]
enabled = true
poll_interval = "5m"
repos = ["wesm/my-project", "roborev-dev/core", "roborev-dev/docs"]
review_types = ["security"]
agents = ["codex"]

github_app_id = 123456
github_app_private_key = "~/.roborev/roborev.pem"

# Each org/user has its own app installation
[ci.github_app_installations]
wesm = 111111
roborev-dev = 222222
```

### Per-Repo Overrides

Global config (`~/.roborev/config.toml`) sets defaults for all repos:

```toml
[ci]
enabled = true
poll_interval = "5m"
repos = ["myorg/backend", "myorg/frontend"]
review_types = ["security"]
agents = ["codex"]

github_app_id = 123456
github_app_private_key = "~/.roborev/roborev.pem"
github_app_installation_id = 12345678
```

The backend repo wants deeper reviews with multiple agents. Add a `.roborev.toml` in the backend repo root:

```toml
# myorg/backend/.roborev.toml

[ci]
review_types = ["security", "default"]
agents = ["codex", "gemini"]
reasoning = "thorough"
```

The frontend repo is lower-risk and only needs a fast security scan:

```toml
# myorg/frontend/.roborev.toml

[ci]
review_types = ["security"]
agents = ["codex"]
reasoning = "fast"
```

Result: `backend` PRs get a 2x2 matrix (4 jobs) with thorough reasoning, while `frontend` PRs get a single fast security review. Repos without a `.roborev.toml` `[ci]` section use the global defaults.

### Wildcard Repos with Exclusions

```toml
[ci]
enabled = true
poll_interval = "5m"
repos = ["myorg/*"]
exclude_repos = ["myorg/archived-*", "myorg/docs"]
max_repos = 50
review_types = ["security"]
agents = ["codex"]

github_app_id = 123456
github_app_private_key = "~/.roborev/roborev.pem"
github_app_installation_id = 12345678
```

### Personal Auth -- Single Review

```toml
[ci]
enabled = true
poll_interval = "5m"
repos = ["myorg/backend", "myorg/frontend"]
review_types = ["security"]
agents = ["claude-code"]
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
```

## Quota Handling

When an agent hits a hard rate or quota limit, roborev puts that agent into a timed cooldown instead of failing the review immediately.

| Setting | Default | Range |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Cooldown duration | 30 minutes | 1 minute to 24 hours |

During cooldown:

- The agent is skipped for new jobs. CI comments show "skipped (quota)" for that agent instead of "failed".
- If a backup agent is configured (see [Backup Agents](/configuration/#backup-agents)) and is not also in cooldown, the job is retried with the backup agent automatically.
- Commit status is set to `success` when all agents in a batch were skipped due to quota. This prevents quota exhaustion from blocking PRs.
- The cooldown timer resets each time the agent hits a quota error, so persistent overuse keeps the agent paused.

No configuration is needed. Quota detection and cooldown are automatic. The daemon logs cooldown start and end events so you can monitor agent availability.

## CI Review (GitHub Actions)

The CI poller described above runs inside the roborev daemon as a background service. For teams that prefer a stateless, daemon-free approach, `roborev ci review` runs reviews directly inside a GitHub Actions workflow.

### When to Use Each Approach

| | Daemon CI Poller | `ci review` in GitHub Actions |
|---|---|---|
| **Runs on** | Your machine or server (daemon) | GitHub-hosted runners |
| **State** | SQLite database tracks reviewed SHAs | Stateless; runs on every trigger |
| **Setup** | `~/.roborev/config.toml` with `[ci]` | GitHub Actions workflow file |
| **Best for** | Continuous polling, centralized review | Per-PR checks, no infrastructure |

### Quickstart with `init gh-action`

The fastest way to set up CI reviews is with the workflow generator:

```bash
cd your-repo
roborev init gh-action --agent claude-code
```

This creates `.github/workflows/roborev.yml`. Commit and push it, then add your agent's API key as a repository secret.

### Required Repository Secrets

Each agent needs its API key as a repository secret:

| Agent | Secret Name |
|-------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Codex | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Gemini | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |

Add secrets in your repository's **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.

### How the Generated Workflow Works

The generated workflow triggers on `pull_request` events and:

1. Checks out the PR branch with full history
2. Downloads the pinned roborev binary and verifies its SHA256 checksum
3. Runs `roborev ci review --comment` with the configured agents
4. Posts review results as a PR comment

In GitHub Actions, `ci review` reads `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, `GITHUB_REF`, and `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` automatically, so no flags are needed beyond `--comment`.

### Customizing via `.roborev.toml`

The `ci review` command reads the repo's `.roborev.toml` for CI-specific settings:

```toml
# .roborev.toml
[ci]
review_types = ["security", "default"]
reasoning = "thorough"
min_severity = "medium"
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `review_types` | array | `["security"]` | Review types to run |
| `reasoning` | string | `"thorough"` | Reasoning level |
| `min_severity` | string | `"low"` | Minimum severity to include in output |

### Manual Workflow Setup

If you prefer full control over the workflow, create `.github/workflows/roborev.yml` manually:

```yaml
name: roborev
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install roborev
        run: |
          curl -fsSL https://roborev.dev/install.sh | bash
          echo "$HOME/.roborev/bin" >> "$GITHUB_PATH"

      - name: Run review
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        run: roborev ci review --comment --agent claude-code
```

Adjust the agent and secrets to match your setup. For multi-agent reviews, pass `--agent` multiple times or use `--review-types` to run different review types.
