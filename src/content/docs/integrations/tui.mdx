The interactive terminal UI (`roborev tui`) provides a real-time view of the review queue.

```bash
roborev tui
```

## Queue View

<video src="/tui-queue.webm" autoplay muted loop playsinline />

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Up`/`k`, `Down`/`j` | Navigate jobs |
| `PgUp`, `PgDn` | Page through list |
| `Enter` | View review |
| `p` | View prompt |
| `m` | View commit message |
| `a` | Toggle addressed |
| `c` | Add comment |
| `y` | Copy review to clipboard |
| `x` | Cancel running/queued job |
| `r` | Rerun completed/failed/canceled job |
| `f` | Filter by repository |
| `h` | Toggle hide addressed/failed/canceled |
| `?` | Show keyboard shortcuts |
| `Esc` | Clear filters (one layer at a time) |
| `q` | Quit |

## Filtering

Press `f` to filter to a single repository, or `h` to hide addressed/failed/canceled reviews and focus on items needing attention.

`Esc` clears filters one layer at a time:
1. If filtered by repository, clears the repository filter first
2. Then clears the hide-addressed filter

Press `h` again to toggle hide-addressed off directly.

## Review View

Press `Enter` on a job to view its review.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Up`/`k`, `Down`/`j` | Scroll content |
| `Left`/`h`, `Right`/`l` | Previous/next review |
| `PgUp`, `PgDn` | Page through content |
| `a` | Toggle addressed |
| `c` | Add comment |
| `y` | Copy review to clipboard |
| `p` | Switch between review/prompt |
| `m` | View commit message |
| `?` | Show keyboard shortcuts |
| `Esc`, `q` | Back to queue |

## Copying Reviews

Press `y` to copy the review content to your clipboard. This works from both the queue view (on completed jobs) and the review detail view.

The copied content includes a metadata header for reference:

```
Review #42 /path/to/repo abc1234
[review content...]
```

A "Copied to clipboard" message confirms the action. The primary use case is pasting the review into an AI coding agent session (like Claude Code) to address the findings. Other uses include sharing with teammates, pasting into issue trackers, or including in PR descriptions.

## Viewing Commit Messages

Press `m` from either the queue view or review detail view to see the full commit message for the selected job. This is useful for understanding the context of the changes being reviewed.

## Keyboard Help

Press `?` at any time to toggle the keyboard shortcuts help overlay. This displays all available shortcuts for the current view.

## Verdicts

Reviews display a **Verdict** (Pass/Fail) parsed from the AI response:

- **Pass** (green): Code review passed with no issues
- **Fail** (red): Issues found that need attention

## Workflow

1. Run `roborev tui` to open the interface
2. Navigate to reviews needing attention
3. Press `Enter` to view full review
4. Address the findings in your code
5. Press `a` to mark as addressed
6. Use `h` to hide addressed items
