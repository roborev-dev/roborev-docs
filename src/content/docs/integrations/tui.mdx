title: Terminal UI (TUI)
description: Interactive terminal interface for viewing and managing reviews
---

The interactive terminal UI (`roborev tui`) provides a real-time view of the review queue.

```bash
roborev tui
```

## Queue View

<video src="/tui-queue.webm" autoplay muted loop playsinline />

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Up`/`k`, `Down`/`j` | Navigate jobs |
| `PgUp`, `PgDn` | Page through list |
| `Enter` | View review |
| `t` | View live agent output (running jobs) |
| `p` | View prompt |
| `m` | View commit message |
| `a` | Toggle addressed |
| `c` | Add comment |
| `y` | Copy review to clipboard |
| `x` | Cancel running/queued job |
| `r` | Rerun completed/failed/canceled job |
| `f` | Filter by repository |
| `b` | Filter by branch |
| `h` | Toggle hide addressed/failed/canceled |
| `g` | Jump to top of queue |
| `?` | Show keyboard shortcuts |
| `Esc` | Clear filters (one layer at a time) |
| `q` | Quit |

## Tail View (Live Agent Output)

Press `t` on a running job to view live agent output in real-time, similar to `tail -f`.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Up`/`k`, `Down`/`j` | Scroll output |
| `PgUp`, `PgDn` | Page through output |
| `g` | Toggle follow mode / jump to top/bottom |
| `Esc`, `q` | Back to queue |

The tail view features:
- **Follow mode**: Auto-scrolls to show new output as it arrives (toggle with `g`)
- **Memory-bounded**: Output is buffered with per-job and global limits
- **Agent normalization**: Output from different agents is normalized to a consistent format

Output is preserved after job completion, so you can review what happened.

## Filtering

Press `f` to filter by repository, `b` to filter by branch, or `h` to hide addressed/failed/canceled reviews and focus on items needing attention.

To start the TUI with addressed items already hidden, set `hide_addressed_by_default = true` in `~/.roborev/config.toml`. To auto-filter to the current repository on startup, set `auto_filter_repo = true`. See [Configuration](/configuration/) for details.

Pressing `h` toggles the hide-addressed filter for the current session without changing the config.

`Esc` clears filters one layer at a time in the order they were applied. Press `h` again to toggle hide-addressed off directly.

## Review View

Press `Enter` on a job to view its review.

<video src="/tui-review.webm" autoplay muted loop playsinline />

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Up`/`k`, `Down`/`j` | Scroll content |
| `Left`/`h`, `Right`/`l` | Previous/next review (loads more if at end) |
| `PgUp`, `PgDn` | Page through content |
| `a` | Toggle addressed |
| `c` | Add comment |
| `y` | Copy review to clipboard |
| `p` | Switch between review/prompt |
| `m` | View commit message |
| `?` | Show keyboard shortcuts |
| `Esc`, `q` | Back to queue |

## Prompt View

Press `p` from the queue view or review view to see the prompt that was sent to the agent, along with the command line used to invoke it.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Up`/`k`, `Down`/`j` | Scroll content |
| `Left`/`h`, `Right`/`l` | Previous/next prompt |
| `PgUp`, `PgDn` | Page through content |
| `p` | Switch between prompt/review |
| `?` | Show keyboard shortcuts |
| `Esc`, `q` | Back to queue |

The prompt header shows the job ID, git ref, and agent. Below the header, the command line used to run the agent is displayed (truncated to terminal width if needed).

## Copying Reviews

Press `y` to copy the review content to your clipboard. This works from both the queue view (on completed jobs) and the review detail view.

<video src="/tui-copy.webm" autoplay muted loop playsinline />

The copied content includes a metadata header for reference:

```
Review #42 /path/to/repo abc1234
[review content...]
```

A "Copied to clipboard" message confirms the action. The primary use case is pasting the review into an AI coding agent session (like Claude Code) to address the findings. Other uses include sharing with teammates, pasting into issue trackers, or including in PR descriptions.

## Viewing Commit Messages

Press `m` from either the queue view or review detail view to see the full commit message for the selected job. This is useful for understanding the context of the changes being reviewed.

## Keyboard Help

Press `?` at any time to toggle the keyboard shortcuts help overlay. This displays all available shortcuts for the current view.

## Review Screen Layout

The review detail view shows:

```
Review #42 myrepo (codex: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
/path/to/repo abc1234 on feature-branch
Verdict: Pass [ADDRESSED]
```

- **Line 1**: Review identity - job ID, repo name, agent and model (if explicitly configured)
- **Line 2**: Location - repo path, git ref, branch
- **Line 3**: Status - verdict and addressed state

## Verdicts

Reviews display a **Verdict** (Pass/Fail) parsed from the AI response:

- **Pass** (green): Code review passed with no issues
- **Fail** (red): Issues found that need attention

## Rich Markdown Rendering

Reviews and prompts are rendered with full Markdown formatting directly in the terminal. Code blocks display with syntax highlighting, and headings, lists, bold, italic, and inline code all render with appropriate styling.

Code blocks are displayed without word-wrapping — long lines are truncated to the terminal width so diffs and code snippets stay readable. Prose text outside code blocks is word-wrapped naturally.

### Tab Width

Tabs in code blocks are expanded to spaces for consistent display. The default width is 2 spaces. To change it, set `tab_width` in `~/.roborev/config.toml`:

```toml
tab_width = 4  # Expand tabs to 4 spaces (default: 2, range: 1-16)
```

### Terminal Escape Sanitization

Review content from AI agents is sanitized before display. Color and style codes (SGR) are preserved, but potentially harmful escape sequences (cursor movement, terminal title changes, screen clearing) are stripped. This prevents untrusted content from interfering with your terminal.

## Adaptive Colors

The TUI automatically adapts to light and dark terminals. Colors are selected based on your terminal's background to ensure readability in both environments.

## Version Mismatch Warning

If the TUI binary version differs from the running daemon version, a persistent red banner displays at the top of the screen. This prevents confusing behavior from stale binaries (common in post-commit hooks). Restart the daemon with `roborev daemon restart` to resolve.

## Workflow

1. Run `roborev tui` to open the interface
2. Navigate to reviews needing attention
3. Press `Enter` to view full review
4. Address the findings in your code
5. Press `a` to mark as addressed
6. Use `h` to hide addressed items
