## Install

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="macOS / Linux">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://roborev.io/install.sh | bash
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://roborev.io/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Go">
    ```bash
    go install github.com/roborev-dev/roborev/cmd/roborev@latest
    ```

    Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initialize in Your Repo

```bash
cd your-repo
roborev init          # Install post-commit hook
# do some work, generate commits
roborev fix           # Fixes unaddressed reviews
roborev tui           # View reviews in interactive UI
```

:::note
Hook installation automatically detects your git hook manager (Husky, etc.) via `core.hooksPath`.
:::

## What Happens

1. **`roborev init`** installs a post-commit hook in your repo
2. **On each commit**, the hook notifies the roborev daemon
3. **The daemon** queues the commit for review by an AI agent
4. **Reviews** are stored locally in SQLite
5. **View results** with `roborev tui` or `roborev show`

Check the daemon status at any time:

## Addressing Reviews

### With `roborev fix`

The quickest way to address a review is to let an agent fix it:

```bash
roborev fix                        # Fix all unaddressed reviews on this branch
roborev fix 123                    # Fix a specific review by job ID
```

The agent applies changes, commits, and marks the review as addressed.
This is a one-shot fix — use `refine` (below) if you want automatic re-review.

### With `roborev refine`

For a fully automated loop that re-reviews fixes and keeps iterating:

```bash
roborev refine                     # Fix all failed reviews, re-review, repeat
roborev refine --max-iterations 5  # Limit iterations
```

Refine finds failed reviews, runs an agent to fix them, waits for re-review, and
repeats until everything passes. See [Auto-Fix with Refine](/guides/auto-fixing/).

### In the TUI

You can also browse reviews in the TUI, mark them addressed with the `a` key,
and press `y` to copy a review to your clipboard for pasting into your agent
session. You can also use the [agent skills](/guides/agent-skills/) for
supported agents.
