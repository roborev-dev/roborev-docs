description: Get up and running with roborev in minutes

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://roborev.io/install.sh | bash
```

Or with Go:

```bash
go install github.com/roborev-dev/roborev/cmd/roborev@latest
```

Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

## Initialize in Your Repo

```bash
cd your-repo
roborev init          # Install post-commit hook
git commit -m "..."   # Reviews happen automatically
roborev tui           # View reviews in interactive UI
```

:::note
Hook installation automatically detects your git hook manager (Husky, etc.) via `core.hooksPath`.
:::

## What Happens

1. **`roborev init`** installs a post-commit hook in your repo
2. **On each commit**, the hook notifies the roborev daemon
3. **The daemon** queues the commit for review by an AI agent
4. **Reviews** are stored locally in SQLite
5. **View results** with `roborev tui` or `roborev show`

Check the daemon status at any time:

## Addressing Reviews in the TUI

One easy way to get going is to just look at reviews in the TUI and
mark them addressed with the `a` key to help you keep track of what
reviews you have addressed in your codebase. An easy way to address is
to copy-and-paste the review into your agent session. You can also use
the [agent skills](/guides/agent-skills/) for supported agents.
